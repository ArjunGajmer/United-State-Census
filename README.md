# United-State-Census

The data here is for the "Census Income" dataset, which contains data on adults from the 1994 census. This data is labeled with whether the person's yearly income is above or below $50K.



The workflow for the project is described in  steps given below:
1. Perform data cleaning using pandas library. Which includes replacing the miscoded information and handling missing data.
2. Make a Exploratory Data Analysis on the data using pandas.
3. Visualize distributions and correlation of features using seaborn and pandas
4. Build a classification model for the classification of income.
5. Try different classifiers and compare the accuracy of all the classifiers.
 
The project is done under the Machine Learning Course  provided by [Acidview](https://acadview.com) under the guindance of Mr Shreyas Raghvan and Ms Meghna P Ayyar.
